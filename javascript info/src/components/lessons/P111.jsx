                        JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only
                        language, but it is now used in many other environments
                        as well.

                        Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most
                        widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with
                        HTML/CSS.

                    <li>
                        There are many languages that get “transpiled” to
                        JavaScript and provide certain features. It is
                        recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly,
                        after mastering JavaScript.
